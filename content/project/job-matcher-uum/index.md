title: A Development of a System to Match Job with Past Scholarly Publications
summary: Matching a job based on oneâ€™s knowledge and experience is not a straightforward task. However, the degree of  difficulty for finding a job that suit each other is increasing dramatically over years. Therefore, a project is proposed to develop a system to match job with past achievements or proven experiences. This project is to provide an automated platform in matching jobs with past achievements or proven experiences to find right job candidates.

3. Show the job description by clicking the "ðŸ”½" button.
4. Sort job list by ascending or descending.
5. Match the job by clicking "Match" button.
6. Matching rate list between the selected job and acedemic staff will be listed out.
7. Sort matching rate list by matching rate.
8. Change the entries that will show the list in one page.
9. Search academic staff by inputting the name.
10. Redirect to the selected job by clicking the job name.
11. Redirect to the scopuslink of selected academic staff by clicking the academic staff name.
